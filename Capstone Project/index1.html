        <li>Simple Shopping Cart Backend ( from UDEMY course):<br/>
            Developed a simple backend system for a fruit shopping cart application using object-oriented programming (OOPS) <br/>
           principles and data structures such as hash tables in C++. This demonstrates the core functionalities of a shopping cart, <br/>
           including product selection, cart management, and checkout processes. It provides a clear understanding of backend logic for<br/> 
           e-commerce platforms, focusing on efficient data handling and seamless user interactions.<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            Study of X-ray spectral evolution of Z-type neutron star X-ray binaries :<br/>
            Analyzing the X-ray light curve of Cygnus X-2, identified variations in brightness linked to the orbital motion of the binary <br/>
           system. Construction of the Hardness-Intensity curve unveiled a connection between the energy (hardness) of X-rays and <br/>
           their intensity. It involved techniques for plotting Energy Spectra graphs, enabling a comprehensive examination of the <br/>
           energy distribution of X-rays emitted by Cygnus X-2.
        </li>
        <li>UV Continuum and line variability studies of Seyfert Galaxy :<br/>
            Calculated average wavelength of the strongest line in our dataset. Observed trend in the combined flux of continuum and <br/>
           line emissions from the Seyfert galaxy NGC-4151. This observation is particularly intriguing as it underscores the presence <br/>
           of Mg(II) transitions within the emission spectra of AGNs, indicating the prevalence of ionized magnesium in the active <br/>
           nucleus of NGC-4151.
